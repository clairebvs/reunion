## Synthesis

Included with your pull request, you must submit answers to the following questions:

* What do you think we were trying to get you to learn with this challenge?
* Outline in words (at least 5-6 sentences) what your code is doing in order to solve this problem.
* What was the most difficult portion of this for you?
* What came naturally to you?

1) I think you were trying to make us work on classes interaction (see iteration 3).
Also this test/code makes us working on testing and hashes.

2) To solve this problem we have to create an activity that has attributes : name, participants and cost.
Then we have to figure out how much each participants are spending for an activity. Adding the different activities they participate to know how much they spent in total.

3) It started to be difficult for total cost (so end of iteration 1) and also iteration 2.

4) Naturally what comes to me is to look for the different attributes of the class do the test and define them.
